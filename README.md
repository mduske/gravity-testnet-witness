Gravity Testnet Witness

I am running the Witness node "g2640m3780t7570s9320" on the Gravity Testnet. You can check on the Block Eplorer the stats on my [Witness Node](https://explorer.gravity.io/witnesses) and [Account](https://explorer.gravity.io/accounts/g2640m3780t7570s9320), and hopefully vote for it on the [Wallet](https://wallet.gravity.io/cabinet/voting/).

Gravity is based on Steem/BitShares so it inherits some very novel features such as the Delegated Proof of Stake (modified for Proof-of-Authority) which concentrates block creation on the Witness nodes and allows for higher block creation speed and transaction throughput. 

The [white paper](https://gravity.io/Gravity-Solutions-Business-Framework.pdf), does mention down-to-earth business concerns and I am anxious to see how IOT (extremely high throughput by nature) and contracts will play out once made available on the platform.
